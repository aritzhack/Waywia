## What is Waywia?
Waywia is a open source 2D game made by aritzhack and distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPLv3

----
## Using the source code

1. You'll need [slick2d-maven] (https://github.com/nguillaumin/slick2d-maven "Slick2D-Maven") so that the project can build using maven
2. In the root folder of the source (where `pom.xml` is located) run `mvn install`
3. Set up your environment so that java runs with `-Djava.library.path=target/natives`

## Contributing

Even though this is a personal experiment-project, feel free to make a [pull request](https://github.com/aritzhack/Waywia/pulls "Waywia pull requests"). However, I'd prefer that you just make an issue describing the problem, and let me solve it by myself.
